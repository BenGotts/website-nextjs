                Hi there! My name is Benjamin Gottschalk and I am a motivated Software Engineer with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from Oregon State University. My time at OSU has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science principles and mathematics, allowing me to solve complex problems and engineer innovative solutions.

                Beyond my academics, I am a competitive Rubik's Cube solver, regularly participating in competitions all over the world! I also play the trumpet, and had the privilege of performing with the Oregon State University Marching Band (OSUMB) throughout my college years.
