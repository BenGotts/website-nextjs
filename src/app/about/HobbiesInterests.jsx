            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700">
              <li><strong>Rubik's Cubes:</strong> I enjoy solving Rubik's Cubes and regularly help organize and run as well as participate in WCA competitions.</li>
              <li><strong>Music:</strong> Playing the trumpet has been a significant part of my life. Such as performing with the Oregon State University Marching Band (OSUMB) throughout my college years and currently performing with the Hillsboro Symphony Orchestra (HSO).</li>
              <li><strong>Coding Projects:</strong> I like to code up random projects, exploring new technologies (such as this website with Next.JS) and pushing the boundaries of what I can create with code.</li>
            </ul>
